# Computer_Architecture_project
The goal of this project is to create a five-stage pipelined processor that can run a single array sorting algorithm. Verilog HDL is used to design the processor, and RISC-V assembly language is used to write the sorting algorithm. We first implemented the sorting algorithm on a single-cycle processor, which is then converted into a pipelined one. We also implemented the forwarding unit and hazard detection module to speed up the execution as much as possible.
